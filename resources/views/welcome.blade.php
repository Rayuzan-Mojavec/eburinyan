                Modern-day Jordan has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period. Three kingdoms emerged there at
                the
                end of the Bronze Age: Ammon, Moab and Edom. In the third century BC, the Arab Nabataeans established their
                Kingdom with Petra as the capital. Later rulers of the Transjordan region include the Assyrian, Babylonian,
                Roman, Byzantine, Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, and the Ottoman empires. After the Great Arab Revolt against
                the
                Ottomans in 1916 during World War I, the Greater Syria region was partitioned by Britain and France. The
                Emirate
                of Transjordan was established in 1921 by the Hashemite, then Emir, Abdullah I, and the emirate became a
                British
                protectorate. In 1946, Jordan gained independence and became officially known in Arabic as the Hashemite
                Kingdom
                of Jordan.[11] The country captured and annexed the West Bank during the 1948 Arabâ€“Israeli War until it was
                occupied by Israel in 1967. Jordan renounced its claim to the territory in 1988, became the second Arab
                state to
                sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, and since supports Palestinian statehood within a two-state
                solution.[12]

                Jordan is a semi-arid country, covering an area of 89,342 km2 (34,495 sq mi), with a population of 10
                million,
                making it the eleventh-most populous Arab country. The dominant majority, or around 95% of the country's
                population, is Sunni Muslim, with a mostly Arab Christian minority. Jordan was mostly unscathed by the
                violence
                that swept the region following the Arab Spring in 2010.[13] From as early as 1948, Jordan has accepted
                refugees
                from multiple neighbouring countries in conflict. An estimated 2.1 million Palestinian and 1.4 million
                Syrian
                refugees are present in Jordan as of a 2015 census; with most Palestinian refugees holding Jordanian
                citizenship.[4] The kingdom is also a refuge for thousands of Christian Iraqis fleeing persecution by the
                Islamic State.[14][15] While Jordan continues to accept refugees, the recent large influx from Syria placed
                substantial strain on national resources and infrastructure.[16]

                The sovereign state is a constitutional monarchy, but the king holds wide executive and legislative powers.
                Jordan is a founding member of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation. The country has
                a
                high Human Development Index, ranking 102nd, and is considered a lower middle income economy. The Jordanian
                economy, one of the smallest economies in the region, is attractive to foreign investors based upon a
                skilled
                workforce.[17] The country is a major tourist destination, also attracting medical tourism due to its well
                developed health sector.[18] Nonetheless, a lack of natural resources, large flow of refugees, and regional
                turmoil have hampered economic growth.[19]
